Remember, Florida was bought from Spain not that long ago. In plain English, I still remember it like it was yesterday.

## How Multi-Cultural Me Would Go About Things From Here

- Take a trip to China (not Taiwan).
- Cut a lot of deals with the Chinese.
- Up next, take a trip to another country with a red-yellow flag, Spain. Make profitable exchanges with Spaniards on the goods bought from China.
- Use the proceeds to fund a trip to Thailand. Buy a lot of Siamese cats from Thailand.
- Fly over to Mexico. Sell the Siamese cats for five times the Thai market rate to the residents there that think the cats are oh so exotic.
- Move back to Florida. Stay unemployed there, and squander all the profits made.
- The end.
